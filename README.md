## ADDDED UPGRADE IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL:

Upgraded Battleships Game:
https://github.com/Sokom141/BattleShip/issues
https://awesomeopensource.com/project/Sokom141/BattleShip

## Description:
Two players get connected through open port over internet or locally hosted port, a board is generated x by y square where players are given a set number of ships of random length. Placement of ships in any part inside the given board of their choice. Once both sides are ready, whoever is lucky to get the direct shot is able to make another hit, if the player misses, the next turn is their opponent. A hit or misses on the opponent board will mark the square, making it unavailable to be hit again. With that, the game ended when one of the players no longer had any ship alive.

## Educational Goals:

Meant to guide contributors to improve upon TDD method of development and especially groups development setting. With that, the project is played using networks hence multithreading will be part of the learning experience. TO which should not be a problem for CIS3296 students with 3207 previous experience.
The project also uses networking technology which is an extremely important and exciting  software topic that group members can work on.


## Technology:
+ Maven
+ JDK 14
+ JUnit 5 for testing
+ IntelliJ form creator for .form files ( GUI components )
+ Window 10
+ Github for version controls

## Proposed Contribution:

Project on implementing a new feature of power ups, single-player, clearing lines and setting up mines, scanning location of ships or defense against shots from an opponent on a square or lines. This improvement meant to improve upon basic trading on random squares in battleship games. Such power up will have a particular cost and implementation along with points earned, a maximum stack on power ups available for usage per game. As to balance out against continuous losses, losing players may receive bonus points earned per hit on opponents. This will guarantee fair play and fun experience for all participants on the new and improved battleship.
Players will also have the ability to play solo against the computer if they do not have a connection to the internet.

+ Once downloaded, navigate to where the file is saved and double click it to run. 
+ When the game menu is displayed, click "host game" to begin a game. 
+ Then to join a game, you can either use the same BattleShip instance, or run another instance of the BattleShip and select "join game".
++ The correct IP and port will have to be supplied. 

### *From your IDE*
+ Fire up your favorite ide and make sure you have java 14 installed on our machine. 
++ If you are using Intellij, you will have to follow a few steps to get the code to compilesuccessfully. 
+ From Intellij, hit File->Settings->Editor->GUI Designer. 
+ Once this window is opened up, click the button that says generate GUI into java source code. 
++ This will allow you to develop, test, and run the BattleShip program from your IDE. 

### *Local Network Only*
The game works with no issues when using it on a local network.
More testing and development is to come with using the public internet to run the game.

## Vision Statement
This game is being developed for people of all ages who enjoy playing the classic game, BattleShip. People who 
love to play battleship, but may not have the time to set up a classic board and play

to be average and can navigate the BattleShip UI very easily. She likes the simple controls

## John Crane

Amanda, age 33, is an elementary school teacher at Jarrettown Elementary School
in Upper Dublin, PA. She graduated from Millersville University. She’s been teaching fifth
grade for just over 3 years now and she absolutely loves her job and her students.
She also has a two year old daughter and a five year old son, so she's no stranger
to working with little kids. In fact, she's so good with her students that she’s
essentially solidified her status as the cool teacher.

During the rainy autumn months, recess for the students is often held indoors.
While Amanda likes to watch her students play amongst themselves in the classroom,
it's clear that some of them get pretty fidgety during indoor recess since
there are only a few board games they can play with. Amanda is thinking about
introducing a virtual BattlesShip game to her students since
they could play it on their school issued laptops. She's as confident with
technology as the typical millenial so she should be able to get the kids setup
with the game fairly easily. Some of the students play computer games at home as well, so Amanda
thinks this could be a great way to keep the kids occupied. Ideally for her, the
game would be easy enough for the students to play on their own so she can
enjoy a break while the kids have indoor recess.
