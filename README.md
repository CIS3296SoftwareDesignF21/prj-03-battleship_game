## ADDDED UPGRADE IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL:

Upgraded Battleships Game: 
https://github.com/Sokom141/BattleShip/issues
https://awesomeopensource.com/project/Sokom141/BattleShip

## Description:
Two players get connected through open port over internet or locally hosted port, a board is generated x by y square where players are given a set number of ships of random length. Placement of ships in any part inside the given board of their choice. Once both sides are ready, whoever is lucky to get the direct shot is able to make another hit, if the player misses, the next turn is their opponent. A hit or misses on the opponent board will mark the square, making it unavailable to be hit again. With that, the game ended when one of the players no longer had any ship alive.

## Educational Goals:

Meant to guide contributors to improve upon TDD method of development and especially groups development setting. With that, the project is played using networks hence multithreading will be part of the learning experience. TO which should not be a problem for CIS3296 students with 3207 previous experience.

## Technology:
+ Maven
+ JDK 14
+ JUnit 5 for testing
+ IntelliJ form creator for .form files ( GUI components )
+ Window 10
+ Github for version controls

## Proposed Contribution:

Project on implementing a new feature of power ups, single-player, clearing lines and setting up mines, scanning location of ships or defense against shots from an opponent on a square or lines. This improvement meant to improve upon basic trading on random squares in battleship games. Such power up will have a particular cost and implementation along with points earned, a maximum stack on power ups available for usage per game. As to balance out against continuous losses, losing players may receive bonus points earned per hit on opponents. This will guarantee fair play and fun experience for all participants on the new and improved battleship.
