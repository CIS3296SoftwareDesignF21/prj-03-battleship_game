Tanaka is a 21 year old gaming enthusiast and gamer who works at a PNC Bank's IT department. He enjoys playing video games regularly but is unable to play the games he plays at home due to his job. Since he enjoys multiplayer games online, he decides he can play the Battleship game with his coworkers locally and if need be online with others. Tanaka is interested in this version of battleship because of the different features implemented. Such features are power ups, the auto placement for the ships, as well as the online multiplayer aspect. Compared to the traditional version of Battleship, he prefers to play this version because each game is also very short due to the power ups. Due to the power ups, it can be an easy win or easy loss which enables him to play with another opponent faster than the traditional battleship game. He is able to navigate the Battleship UI very easily because of his technological background and is able to understand the game with the added featuress.

grade for just over 3 years now and she absolutely loves her job and her students.

to working with little kids. In fact, she's so good with her students that she’s
essentially solidified her status as the cool teacher.

During the rainy autumn months, recess for the students is often held indoors.
While Amanda likes to watch her students play amongst themselves in the classroom,
it's clear that some of them get pretty fidgety during indoor recess since
there are only a few board games they can play with. Amanda is thinking about
introducing a virtual BattlesShip game to her students since
they could play it on their school issued laptops. She's as confident with
technology as the typical millenial so she should be able to get the kids setup
with the game fairly easily. Some of the students play computer games at home as well, so Amanda
thinks this could be a great way to keep the kids occupied. Ideally for her, the
game would be easy enough for the students to play on their own so she can
enjoy a break while the kids have indoor recess.
